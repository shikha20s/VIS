			<h3 style="color:orange;">Introduction</h3>
			<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:24px;"> Privacy can be defined as “the condition of being secluded or isolated from view of or from contact with others.” (Morris, 1991). Clarke (1999) defined privacy as “the interest that individuals have in sustaining a personal space, free from interference by other people and organisations.” In terms of human rights, privacy can be defined as “the right to be let alone.” (Wang, et al., 1998) Milberg, et al. (1995) defined personal information privacy as “the ability of the individual to personally control information about himself.”

						However, with the phenomenal increase in the use of the Internet, privacy has become a major concern (Guynes, 1996; Meeks, 1997; 1999). According to U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), 85 percent of all Web sites collect personal information from consumers; however, only 14 percent have posted their privacy practices (Cranor, 1998). A Business Week/Harris survey concluded that privacy is the number one issue facing the Internet. The same survey mentioned, if privacy practices were exposed, 78 percent of Internet users would increase their use of the Internet and 61 percent of the non–Internet users would likely use the Internet (Benassi, 1999). These numbers shows that concern for privacy is highly affecting electronic commerce.

						Milberg, et al. (1995) studied the relationships between nationality, cultural values and privacy concerns. However, this study did not address relationships between human rights and privacy legislation. Wang, et al. (1998) presented a suite of “privacy principles,” specifically focusing on the situation in the U.S. Hence, the issue was not treated as a global concern.

						Cranor (1999) proposed a variety of regulatory and self–regulatory privacy protection approaches but the issue of enforcement was not addressed. Clarke (1999) discussed the problems inherent in an absence of a unified privacy framework and proposed a unified alternative. However, Clarke’s framework did not address enforcement and related problems.

						This brief and incomplete sampling of privacy studies certainly demonstrates that there is a problem with consumer privacy on the Internet. There is an obvious need to address this problem holistically on a global scale, rather than on a national or regional level.

						Therefore, it has become necessary to address privacy concerns for all of the parties involved. This paper will examine the ways in which privacy is being violated and existing efforts that have been made to protect consumer privacy on the Internet. We will also review different privacy–enhancing technologies. The problems of current national and international efforts attempting to provide privacy protection will also addressed. We will then propose a role for the United Nations (UN) in creating international privacy legislation.

			<h3 style="color:orange;">How is consumer privacy being violated?</h3>
			<p style="font-size:16px;">Wang, et al. (1998) proposed a taxonomy for consumer privacy concerns. 
			This taxonomy consisted of four main classes — improper acquisition, improper use, privacy invasion and 
			improper storage of personal private information without prior approval of consumers.
				</p>
			
			<h3 style="color:black;">Improper acquisition</h3>
			<p style="font-size:16px;">
			This taxonomy includes inappropriate access to the computers of consumers, leading to the collection of private information 
			and monitoring of Internet activities without the knowledge of consumers. As an example, RealNetwork used to monitor users 
			identities of users as well as their preferences and Internet activities with RealJukebox (Dekleva, 2000).
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="color:black;">Improper use</h3>
			<p style="font-size:16px;">
			A variety of tactics fall under this category including the transfer of private information about consumers without their acknowledgment. 
			For example, DoubleClick.net at one point tracked how individuals surfed Web advertisements, noting their preferences (Wang, et al., 1998). 
			In another case, Universal Image sued Yahoo for US$4 billion for its failure to disclose user information (Dekleva, 2000).
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="color:black;">Privacy invasion</h3>
			<p style="font-size:16px;">
			Private information about specific consumers can be transferred to a second party without the consent of individuals, 
			leading to spam and other problems. For example, ReverseAuction.com collected personal information about eBay customers,
			using this data to gather customers improperly from its rival (Dekleva, 2000).
			</p>
			
			<h3 style="color:black;">Improper storage</h3>
			<p style="font-size:16px;">
			There are enormous security issues over stored digital information and especially safeguards for this data. 
			For example, in 2003, about 59,000 social security numbers and personal data were collected from the University of 
			Texas at Austin computer system by hackers (Privacy.org, 2003).
